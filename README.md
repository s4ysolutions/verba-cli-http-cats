# CLI LLM-Powered Language Translator: Command-Line Tool and web service

## Motivation

- **Serbian Language Support**: Full integration for translating to and from Serbian, leveraging AI for accurate and
  contextual results.
- **Stable Output**: Achieved through a unified, thoroughly developed prompt template that ensures consistent and
  reliable translations.
- **Easy Model Switching**: Seamlessly toggle between AI models (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-5) for balancing speed, cost, and
  quality.
- **Input Preparation and Sanitization**: Robust preprocessing to clean and validate user input, preventing errors and
  ensuring high-quality results.
- **Convenient Integration**: Web service counterpart of Swift version designed to workaround API keys security
  restrictions on Apple platforms.

## Architecture

This project follows a clean architecture pattern to promote modularity, testability, and maintainability:

- **Domain package**: Shared core entities including configurations, requests, responses, and driven ports (interfaces)
  for business logic.
- **Adapters package**: Shared concrete implementations for specific AI providers and models, allowing pluggable
  backends.
- **Application package**: Implements a shared use case that orchestrates domain validation, prompt generation and
  repository interactions.
- **CLI package**: A simple command-line interface serving as the primary presentation layer for user interaction.
- **Web Service Module**: A http4s-based web service providing RESTful endpoints for translation requests.
